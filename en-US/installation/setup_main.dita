    <conbody>
        <p>Select <menucascade><uicontrol>File</uicontrol><uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol></menucascade> from the main menu to set up the teacher module.</p>
        <p><wintitle>Teacher module settings</wintitle> window (<xref keyref="setup_main/setup_main_png" type="fig"/>&#160;) will appear on your screen. Here you can change <uicontrol>Path to teacher folders</uicontrol><indexterm>teacher folders</indexterm> where each teacher can store class files, session files, student records, etc.</p>
        <fig id="setup_main_png">
            <title><wintitle>Teacher module settings</wintitle> window</title>

            </image>
        </fig>
        <p>Here you can also change user interface language, maximum number of groups in the class, and default sound devices for playback and capture.</p>
        <p>By selecting <uicontrol>Optimize audio for Wi-Fi networks (disable multicast)</uicontrol> option you can increase sound quality over the Wi-Fi networks at the expense of increase in network traffic.</p>
        <p>By selecting <uicontrol>Optimize video for Wi-Fi networks (disable multicast)</uicontrol> option you can increase video quality over the Wi-Fi networks at the expense of increase in network traffic. Once this option is enabled, students will also be able to adjust video playback position.</p>
        <note type="important">Check the <uicontrol>Use voice switch</uicontrol> option if you are experiencing poor sound quality over Wi-Fi networks. This will enable software voice switch that will increase sound quality at the expense of increase in sound delays and CPU load on the teacher workstation.</note>
        <p>If you are using <wintitle>Dialog Nibelung</wintitle> together with the <wintitle>Dialog 5</wintitle> audio hub (see <xref keyref="commutator_switch"/>&#160;), you will have to set the <uicontrol>Transmit audio using Dialog 5 audio hub</uicontrol> option here.</p>
        <p>You can also set the deafault size for the whiteboard (see section <xref keyref="whiteboard"/>&#160;) here.</p>
